# iMoney Drupal Camp Manila 2014 Challenge!

Welcome! You are probably here because you have set your mind to embark on an exciting career with iMoney! We are looking for Senior Drupal Developers who are able to mix and match the different contrib modules, write glue code modules, and build custom modules if no solution is available.

You're in the right place if you want to be challenged continously to engineering creative solutions. You will join us in building beautiful and very usable web applications that empower consumers to make better financial decisions. You will also develop internal platform that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our Product, Operations, and Sales teams.

You are also not afraid of [getting off the Drupal island](http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/off-the-island-2013) to work on the other technologies that we use - [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Symfony2](http://symfony.com), [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/), [Crate](https://crate.io/) and whatever other technologies that makes sense for us. Get ready to grow and expand your horizons.

Excited? Please read on..

## What do you need to do?

We have included the XML data dump of our [iMoney Mobile Plans](http://www.imoney.my/mobile-plan-comparison) comparison table. You can build anything you want from that data, but with Drupal 7 + any front end frameworks. Import the content into Drupal 7. Use contrib modules, code custom modules, build calculators / filters, go crazy, save the world and WOW us!
